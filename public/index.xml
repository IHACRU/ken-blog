&lt;h1&gt;Introduction&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;why was this de-identification framework created?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At a foundational level, leveraging better care and more sustainable service system operations through secondary use of health data is all about relationships – between typically large/complex linked arrays of person-level data, and those statistically/methodologically well-equipped parties, often found in academic settings, who have the capacity to transform the data into useful information products. Stated in slightly different terms: the presentation is concerned with the challenges around de-identification of complex, high-dimensional bodies of health data to enable appropriately privacy-preserving disclosure of the data to statisticians/researchers – while preserving the analytical integrity of the data disclosed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;what-makes-disclosure-of-health-data-for-secondary-use-challenging&#34; class=&#34;section level1&#34;&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;What makes disclosure of health data for secondary use challenging?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over and above the obvious challenges associated with data lineage – clinical service data originate within clinical systems in personally identified form – there are additional challenges that may substantially impede efforts to render the data in a form that meets the requirements of data access adjudicators:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol style=&#34;list-style-type: decimal&#34;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Legislation, regulations –
&lt;ol style=&#34;list-style-type: lower-alpha&#34;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Data required to paint a minimally complete picture of a “patient journey” are likely to be held by a diverse array of parties who are subject to different governance structures and bodies of legislation (e.g, PIPA for primary care providers; FIPPA for health authorities);&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Legislation, regulations or framework/guideline documents almost invariably fail to provide operational definitions of key constructs such as “de-identified” or “anonymized”.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To meet legislated/regulatory/ethical obligations, data access adjudicators must navigate through an array of possible approaches, but the sources of those obligations do not address the key question of which type or level of de-identification is required for a given disclosure.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Existing de-identification methodologies “work” for datasets that contain small numbers of demographic features (e.g., date of birth, postal code) and a very circumscribed set of clinical attributes, e.g., a single diagnosis made at a single point in time in a single setting. However, they do not scale out to the typical datasets required from source clinical information systems to optimize point-of-service care delivery processes or service system operations or planning or performance monitoring – see &lt;a href=&#34;../../publication/2019-reboot-conference&#34;&gt;Moselle, Robertson &amp;amp; Koval (2019)&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Parties with custody and control of health data will typically need to cast a broad cross-jurisdictional net to find the diverse array of parties who possess combinations of clinical domain knowledge and up-to-date “data scientific” expertise. Processes that ‘work” for internal uses of data by within-jurisdiction employees for purposes of quality assurance/quality improvement are not sufficient.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of the factors point to a need for cleanly and clearly articulated procedures that “understand” legislated/regulatory/policy obligations, as well as complex, high-dimensional health service data. As well, the methodology must grasp at a deep technical level the statistical basis of procedures required to meet those obligations – and demonstrate that obligations have been fulfilled. Further, the procedures must also understand the need to preserve the analytical integrity of the de-identified data. If the statistically-derived products are going to be fit for purpose, the data must be fit for analysis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;what-is-contained-in-the-framework-set-out-in-the-powerpoint&#34; class=&#34;section level1&#34;&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;What is contained in the framework set out in the powerpoint?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;ol style=&#34;list-style-type: decimal&#34;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Slides #12 - 14 – summary view of data disclosure privacy risk model – this provides the basis for everything else contained in the presentation. It provides a context for operational definitions of key terms such as “de-identified” or “risk”.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Slide #5 – data de-identification options – forming a rough hierarchy – the framework must adjudicate among these options, in keeping with various obligations related to a given data disclosure.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Slides #6-9 – limitations associated with common data de-identification approaches.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Slides #17-20 – what are the components of “me” in “my data”? The distinction between “me” as a distinct individual and “me” as an exemplar of the properties of a cohort.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Slides #21, 22 – the de-identification challenge – how to mask “me” but retain my generic properties.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Slides #23, 24 – Component #1 of the model – identifiability of people and their attributes “in the world”.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Slides #25, 26 – Component #2 – distinguishability of cases in the dataset – mathematical risk, i.e., statistical disclosure control-based definition of “risk”.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Slides #28, 29 – Component #3 – re-identifiability of distinguished cases in the dataset.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Slides #30 – 32 – Component #4 – the “being reasonable” component – what do we mean by “pragmatic/contextualized risk”; game-theoretic definition of “risk”; when does “zero risk” make sense?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Slides 33, 34 – next steps – need for detailed standard operating procedures to operationalize and document each of the four components.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;[Not included in powerpoint] but is available on request] – framework for characterizing data disclosure scenarios – to be used to “stress test” a candidate data disclosure/de-identification methodology and determine where/how it might apply.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;possible-next-steps&#34; class=&#34;section level1&#34;&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Possible next steps&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;ol style=&#34;list-style-type: decimal&#34;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Constitute a group with appropriate skills/knowledge to evaluate the model.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Generate a working set of data disclosure scenarios, spanning community, health authority and ministry data sources.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Specify detailed standard operating procedures, generate working versions of template forms to document the results of the operations, provide benchmarks for evaluating measures of risk.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Work through the standard operating procedures with a privacy-risk-challenging but representative set of data contents, including primary care data (e.g., MSP billing data with diagnoses); Health Authority data (including full cross-continuum encounter data and a subset of orders, e.g,. for medications); Ministry of Health data (e.g., pharmacy data). Document the processes and products with the forms associated with each component of the de-identification model.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div id=&#34;what-is-tia&#34; class=&#34;section level1&#34;&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;What is TIA?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A TIA is an graphical rendering of answers to a series of linked questions relating to analytic products from data to support the functions performed by persons, providers or programs within a health system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The TIA for health service delivery and health service system operations, depicted in this presentation, speaks to the following questions/issues:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol style=&#34;list-style-type: decimal&#34;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Slide #11 - &lt;strong&gt;Component #1&lt;/strong&gt; – Epistemological foundations – where do health issues/problems become manifest, and what types/classes of information do we require to respond to those issues?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Slide #13, #16 – &lt;strong&gt;Component #2&lt;/strong&gt; – what functions - layered organization of the service system and key information-dependent functions performed within layers.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Slide #17, #18 – &lt;strong&gt;Component #3&lt;/strong&gt; – what information products? How are these products keyed to layers within the service system and functions that can be optimized using those products.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Slide #19, #20 – &lt;strong&gt;Component #4&lt;/strong&gt; – what data? To generate the products in Slide #17, where must we go to find the data? How are those contents architected? What contents are foundational?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Slide #21 – &lt;strong&gt;Component #5&lt;/strong&gt; – What statistical/Analytical approaches – what analytical capabilities are required to translate the data from Slide #19 into the products in Slide #17 on behalf of the layers/functions depicted in slide #13.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Slide #22, 23 – &lt;strong&gt;Component #6&lt;/strong&gt; – what actionable, analytical-derived products? What are the information/evidence “deliverables” – what do the programs/providers in Slide #13 “see”? This slide is closely related to Slide #17.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slides #13, 17, 19, and 22 are duplicated in the presentation, with highlighting to show where data from community services, from health authorities, and from the Ministry of Health figure in these architectural renderings. This highlighting is a bit complicated because data sources, data products and data uses from these three sources interact with one another and are often not cleanly demarcated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://diabetes.diabetesjournals.org/content/64/4/1105&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;figure1.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;from The Streetlight Effect—Is There Light at the End of the Tunnel? by Ake Lernmark&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;what-else-is-in-the-presentation&#34; class=&#34;section level1&#34;&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;What else is in the presentation?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;ol style=&#34;list-style-type: decimal&#34;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Slides #5 – 8 – some material related to the question: “&lt;strong&gt;why construct a TIA&lt;/strong&gt;”?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Slides #24 – 26 – putting the model to work –&lt;br /&gt;
a.Slides #19 (what data) and #13 (what products) are used to supply “containers” for displaying the data requirements and intended deliverables associated with a program of research in Island Health that leverages off of the Ministry of Health Minimum Requirements Data for Mental Health &amp;amp; Substance Use – and off of transactional encounter data from the 1700+ program entities that collectively constitute the clinical “business end” of the health authority.&lt;br /&gt;
b.The contents depicted in Slides #25, 26 are intended to illustrate the use of the TIA to catalogue information-relevant contents associated with a complex analytical program of research.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Slides #28-30 – some critical &lt;strong&gt;limitations&lt;/strong&gt; of the TIA in the powerpoint; some principles and other contents abstracted from the TIA model.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Slides #31-33 – lead-in to the second presentation – a brief glimpse into a data disclosure &lt;strong&gt;privacy risk model&lt;/strong&gt; that provides the foundation for a set of standard operating procedures intended to take the types of high-dimensional datasets depicted in Slide #19, subject them to the types of analytical approaches depicted in Slide #21, in order to generate the products depicted in Slide #17 and #22.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;why-construct-a-target-information-architecture&#34; class=&#34;section level1&#34;&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Why construct a Target Information Architecture?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;See Slide #5.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Briefly:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol style=&#34;list-style-type: decimal&#34;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To manage the &lt;strong&gt;complexity&lt;/strong&gt; of generating useful products from health data.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To supply a &lt;strong&gt;targeting mechanism&lt;/strong&gt; for the processes that are involved in setting analytics priorities and structuring the work of programs or divisions that are tasked with working with data to produce products that are intended to perform a function.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To offset a potential for services/programs/systems to work from what data are reasonably readily available, using “in-house” analytical tools and capabilities, to respond to immediate pressures for delivering products.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;possible-next-steps&#34; class=&#34;section level1&#34;&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Possible next steps&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;ol style=&#34;list-style-type: decimal&#34;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create a “wire-frame” version of the architecture that strips out much of the detailed material that relates primarily to services/processes within a health authority (which was the original focus of the TIA in the powerpoint).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Repopulate and possibly re-architect the model with contents that are more fully informed by data that exist within the community/primary care space, reflecting the potential uses of the products derived from those data.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Repopulate and possibly re-architect the model to reflect divisions and planning/executive functions performed within the Ministry of Health.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Repopulate and possibly re-architect the model to reflect data sources across government and the uses of products derived from those sources (e.g,. related to Digital Platforms and Data Division).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
