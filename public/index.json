Stated in slightly different terms: the presentation is concerned with the challenges around de-identification of complex, high-dimensional bodies of health data to enable appropriately privacy-preserving disclosure of the data to statisticians/researchers – while preserving the analytical integrity of the data disclosed.\n\rWhat makes disclosure of health data for secondary use challenging?\rOver and above the obvious challenges associated with data lineage – clinical service data originate within clinical systems in personally identified form – there are additional challenges that may substantially impede efforts to render the data in a form that meets the requirements of data access adjudicators:\nLegislation, regulations –\rData required to paint a minimally complete picture of a “patient journey” are likely to be held by a diverse array of parties who are subject to different governance structures and bodies of legislation (e.g, PIPA for primary care providers; FIPPA for health authorities);\n\rLegislation, regulations or framework/guideline documents almost invariably fail to provide operational definitions of key constructs such as “de-identified” or “anonymized”.\n\rTo meet legislated/regulatory/ethical obligations, data access adjudicators must navigate through an array of possible approaches, but the sources of those obligations do not address the key question of which type or level of de-identification is required for a given disclosure.\n\r\rExisting de-identification methodologies “work” for datasets that contain small numbers of demographic features (e.g., date of birth, postal code) and a very circumscribed set of clinical attributes, e.g., a single diagnosis made at a single point in time in a single setting. However, they do not scale out to the typical datasets required from source clinical information systems to optimize point-of-service care delivery processes or service system operations or planning or performance monitoring – see Moselle, Robertson \u0026amp; Koval (2019).\n\rParties with custody and control of health data will typically need to cast a broad cross-jurisdictional net to find the diverse array of parties who possess combinations of clinical domain knowledge and up-to-date “data scientific” expertise. Processes that ‘work” for internal uses of data by within-jurisdiction employees for purposes of quality assurance/quality improvement are not sufficient.\r\rAll of the factors point to a need for cleanly and clearly articulated procedures that “understand” legislated/regulatory/policy obligations, as well as complex, high-dimensional health service data. As well, the methodology must grasp at a deep technical level the statistical basis of procedures required to meet those obligations – and demonstrate that obligations have been fulfilled. Further, the procedures must also understand the need to preserve the analytical integrity of the de-identified data. If the statistically-derived products are going to be fit for purpose, the data must be fit for analysis.\n\rWhat is contained in the framework set out in the powerpoint?\rSlides #12 - 14 – summary view of data disclosure privacy risk model – this provides the basis for everything else contained in the presentation. It provides a context for operational definitions of key terms such as “de-identified” or “risk”.\n\rSlide #5 – data de-identification options – forming a rough hierarchy – the framework must adjudicate among these options, in keeping with various obligations related to a given data disclosure.\rSlides #6-9 – limitations associated with common data de-identification approaches.\n\rSlides #17-20 – what are the components of “me” in “my data”? The distinction between “me” as a distinct individual and “me” as an exemplar of the properties of a cohort.\n\rSlides #21, 22 – the de-identification challenge – how to mask “me” but retain my generic properties.\n\rSlides #23, 24 – Component #1 of the model – identifiability of people and their attributes “in the world”.\n\rSlides #25, 26 – Component #2 – distinguishability of cases in the dataset – mathematical risk, i.e., statistical disclosure control-based definition of “risk”.\n\rSlides #28, 29 – Component #3 – re-identifiability of distinguished cases in the dataset.\n\rSlides #30 – 32 – Component #4 – the “being reasonable” component – what do we mean by “pragmatic/contextualized risk”; game-theoretic definition of “risk”; when does “zero risk” make sense?\n\rSlides 33, 34 – next steps – need for detailed standard operating procedures to operationalize and document each of the four components.\r[Not included in powerpoint] but is available on request] – framework for characterizing data disclosure scenarios – to be used to “stress test” a candidate data disclosure/de-identification methodology and determine where/how it might apply.\r\r\rPossible next steps\rConstitute a group with appropriate skills/knowledge to evaluate the model.\n\rGenerate a working set of data disclosure scenarios, spanning community, health authority and ministry data sources.\n\rSpecify detailed standard operating procedures, generate working versions of template forms to document the results of the operations, provide benchmarks for evaluating measures of risk.\n\rWork through the standard operating procedures with a privacy-risk-challenging but representative set of data contents, including primary care data (e.g., MSP billing data with diagnoses); Health Authority data (including full cross-continuum encounter data and a subset of orders, e.g,. for medications); Ministry of Health data (e.g., pharmacy data). Document the processes and products with the forms associated with each component of the de-identification model.\r\r\r","date":1563235200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1563235200,"objectID":"362081c8f1910937c770d502b40696d4","permalink":"/post/2019-07-16-data-de-identification/","publishdate":"2019-07-16T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/2019-07-16-data-de-identification/","section":"post","summary":"Linking health records is key to innovation in health care.

How are these products keyed to layers within the service system and functions that can be optimized using those products.\n\rSlide #19, #20 – Component #4 – what data? To generate the products in Slide #17, where must we go to find the data? How are those contents architected? What contents are foundational?\n\rSlide #21 – Component #5 – What statistical/Analytical approaches – what analytical capabilities are required to translate the data from Slide #19 into the products in Slide #17 on behalf of the layers/functions depicted in slide #13.\n\rSlide #22, 23 – Component #6 – what actionable, analytical-derived products? What are the information/evidence “deliverables” – what do the programs/providers in Slide #13 “see”? This slide is closely related to Slide #17.\r\rSlides #13, 17, 19, and 22 are duplicated in the presentation, with highlighting to show where data from community services, from health authorities, and from the Ministry of Health figure in these architectural renderings. This highlighting is a bit complicated because data sources, data products and data uses from these three sources interact with one another and are often not cleanly demarcated.\n\n\rWhat else is in the presentation?\rSlides #5 – 8 – some material related to the question: “why construct a TIA”?\n\rSlides #24 – 26 – putting the model to work –\na.Slides #19 (what data) and #13 (what products) are used to supply “containers” for displaying the data requirements and intended deliverables associated with a program of research in Island Health that leverages off of the Ministry of Health Minimum Requirements Data for Mental Health \u0026amp; Substance Use – and off of transactional encounter data from the 1700+ program entities that collectively constitute the clinical “business end” of the health authority.\nb.The contents depicted in Slides #25, 26 are intended to illustrate the use of the TIA to catalogue information-relevant contents associated with a complex analytical program of research.\n\rSlides #28-30 – some critical limitations of the TIA in the powerpoint; some principles and other contents abstracted from the TIA model.\n\rSlides #31-33 – lead-in to the second presentation – a brief glimpse into a data disclosure privacy risk model that provides the foundation for a set of standard operating procedures intended to take the types of high-dimensional datasets depicted in Slide #19, subject them to the types of analytical approaches depicted in Slide #21, in order to generate the products depicted in Slide #17 and #22.\r\r\rWhy construct a Target Information Architecture?\rSee Slide #5.\nBriefly:\nTo manage the complexity of generating useful products from health data.\rTo supply a targeting mechanism for the processes that are involved in setting analytics priorities and structuring the work of programs or divisions that are tasked with working with data to produce products that are intended to perform a function.\rTo offset a potential for services/programs/systems to work from what data are reasonably readily available, using “in-house” analytical tools and capabilities, to respond to immediate pressures for delivering products.\r\r\rPossible next steps\rCreate a “wire-frame” version of the architecture that strips out much of the detailed material that relates primarily to services/processes within a health authority (which was the original focus of the TIA in the powerpoint).\rRepopulate and possibly re-architect the model with contents that are more fully informed by data that exist within the community/primary care space, reflecting the potential uses of the products derived from those data.\rRepopulate and possibly re-architect the model to reflect divisions and planning/executive functions performed within the Ministry of Health.\rRepopulate and possibly re-architect the model to reflect data sources across government and the uses of products derived from those sources (e.g,. related to Digital Platforms and Data Division).\r\r\r","date":1562803200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1562803200,"objectID":"83e74120e45dfaf03556ceddd8d40a27","permalink":"/post/2019-07-11-target-information-architecture/","publishdate":"2019-07-11T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/2019-07-11-target-information-architecture/","section":"post","summary":"We argue that a developed Target Information Architecture (TIA) is a necessary condition to guide the translation of health service analytics back into a health service system.","tags":["target information architecture","tia","health services","clinical analytics"],"title":"Target Information Architecture","type":"post"},{"authors":["Ken Moselle","Stanley Robertson","Andriy Koval"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1550016000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1550016000,"objectID":"3af0fabf467d9f5abcb006a21336f950","permalink":"/publication/2019-reboot-conference/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2019-reboot-conference/","section":"publication","summary":"This paper presents a framework for addressing data access challenges associated with secondary use of high-dimensional transactional datasets that have been extracted from electronic health/medical records (EHRs).","tags":["Data de-identification","Privacy","Security","Electronic Health Records"],"title":"“Real-world” de-identification of highdimensional transactional health datasets","type":"publication"}]
